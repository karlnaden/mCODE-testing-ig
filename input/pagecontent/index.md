This IG constitutes a test suite to assist in validating that FHIR servers conform to the [minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE) Implementation Guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/). Tests are encoded using FHIR [TestScript](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/testscript.html) resources, generated by the MITRE FHIR Foundry [TestScript Generator](https://github.com/fhir-crucible/testscript-generator), and targeted for execution on the MITRE FHIR Foundry [TestScript Engine](https://github.com/fhir-crucible/testscript-engine) using profiles and extensions found in [this IG](https://fhir-crucible.github.io/testscript-engine-ig/).

Current server conformance features that can be tested include:
- [mCODE profile search and read support](search-and-read-tests.html)

Tests for additional features have been discussed and some are in progress
- [mCODE profile element must support read](must-support-read-tests.html)
- [mCODE profile element must support write](must-support-write-tests.html)

Ideas for other tests valuable to implementers welcomed.
